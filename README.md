Zurich GitHub Users Data Collection

Data Collection Process: We utilized the GitHub API to scrape user profiles from Zurich with over 50 followers and their repositories. This data was then organized into users.csv and repositories.csv.

Interesting Finding: Surprisingly, a significant number of developers in Zurich work for startups, which are not as prominent in other cities.

Recommendation: Developers should consider open-sourcing their projects to gain more visibility and collaboration opportunities from the global developer community.
