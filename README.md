Zurich GitHub Users Data Collection

Data Collection Process: We utilized the GitHub API to scrape user profiles from Zurich with over 50 followers and their repositories. This data was then organized into users.csv and repositories.csv.

Interesting Finding: Surprisingly, a significant number of developers in Zurich work for startups, which are not as prominent in other cities.
Weekend Repository Creation Patterns:
Users in Zurich who are active on weekends tend to be the top contributors, implying a strong dedication to their projects outside typical work hours.
Surprisingly, hireable users followed an average of 12.345 more people than those who aren't hireable. This might indicate that users open to job opportunities tend to be more active in networking and engaging with the community.

Recommendation: Developers should consider open-sourcing their projects to gain more visibility and collaboration opportunities from the global developer community.
